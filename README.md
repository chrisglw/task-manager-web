# Overview

This project is a simple to-do list application developed using JavaScript to demonstrate language syntax and showcase fundamental web development skills. The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks seamlessly.

The purpose of creating this software is to enhance proficiency in JavaScript and reinforce key concepts in web development. Through this project, I aimed to practice event handling, DOM manipulation, and local storage usage. This project serves as a stepping stone for further exploration of JavaScript and related technologies.
